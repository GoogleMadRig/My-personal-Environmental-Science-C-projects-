# My-personal-Environmental-Science-C-projects- This GitHub repository is the place where I will post my personal C++ projects dedicated to environmental science/environmental conservation. The first coding C++ project calculates the number of 5-device power strips that the users need to unplug all of their pluggable devices in his/her house, apartment, college dorm, etc. by calculating how many pluggable devices are there in the place that the user is in and dividing that by a simple 5-device power strip. The second C++ coding project calculates how many light bulbs are in the user's residence. These two separate C++ coding projects could help calculate how much power the user uses at home, later on, to encourage the user to lower their overall power consumption.
